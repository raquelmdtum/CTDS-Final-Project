    "To calculate similar items using ingredients we choose to embed ingredients with TF-IDF. This was chosen because TF-IDF will take into account the uniqueness of ingredients. For example water is a frequent ingredient in the list which does not tell us a lot about the product. Where as salicylic acid does not occur as often leading to higher importance. To compute the similarity between products we choose cosine similarity because TF-IDF gives results in the form of embedding."
